              If you're reading this, chances are that you know me. If that is the case, then you probably also know
              that I have this fun little habit of starting projects that are doomed to be forgotten. I was looking
              back at some of these projects a couple of days ago and decided that I would finish a couple of these 
              before starting anything new. Of course, I <em>immediately</em> began work on this website to keep track of these things.
              So while I might not see all of my projects through to their end, I want to at least go through and document the things that I learn while doing them. This
              notebook will mainly
              serve as a place for me to take notes on those projects I have done in the past and those which I will
              inevitably start
              in the future. It will also allow me to better keep tabs on where I am with my current projects. You are
              welcome to read it.
              </br>
              </br>
              This marks the start of a new project. I have been meaning to start a personal website for a while, but I
              am not much of a web developer. I got the idea to also start tracking my work from my friend William
              Bucher, who
              recently started a photography blog. I then thought that this would be a good way for me to keep myself
              honest
              about working on my side projects. I plan to randomly select a project every day or two from a list of
              things
              I am currently working on. Then I will try to work on that project for at least one hour that day and take
              notes about
              whatever it is I did or learned. Since I am still figuring out what my schedule will look like for this
              Fall, this
              plan may change. I think trying to do work in these short bursts will keep things fresh while also ensuring that 
              I am constantly making forward progress on something. I'm hoping to be able to look back on this and be proud of all of the little
              things I have accomplished.
              </br>
              </br>
              For this website, I used a couple of templates from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. 
              This allowed me to get a barebones site up very quickly that looks decently passable. It also means that I will have to deal 
              very minimally with CSS. I dislike using CSS. I then went and simplified the color palettes, something I know very little about, 
              so I apologize if the site offends the senses. Finally, I touched it up with a few pictures, some smooth scrolling 
              effects, and this post. I am hoping to make this into a very well-organized notebook with tagged notes and sorting, 
              but that will come later. For now, all of the posts will be hardcoded right here.
