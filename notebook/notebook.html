                        <p>
                            Today I finished reading <i>Chaos: Making a New Science</i> by James Gleick. My granddad 
                            gave me this copy earlier this year and told me that I "have to read it if I am going to be 
                            a scientist." I don't really plan on being a scientist, but this book was inspiring, nevertheless. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Originally published in 1987, it discusses the breakthroughs in understanding quote "the irregular 
                            unpredictable behavior of deterministic, nonlinear dynamical systems." I'll try to describe what I think this 
                            means a bit later. It is remarkable to think about the state of science 35 years ago, and this book 
                            brought up some interesting ideas that I think we really take for granted today.

                            As you can see, I took a bit of a break. This is all Mr. Robot's fault. All of my personal
                            project time
                            was transformed
                            into TV time the past couple of weeks, and it has been amazing. I finished watching Mr.
                            Robot, and it was
                            absolutely fantastic.
                            Although I am definitely the target audience for the show, I think I can confidently say
                            that this is top
                            3 television shows
                            I have watched. Highly recommend.

                            Anywho, it is time for me to write down some of my notes from the stuff I did find time to
                            work on. I
                            mostly just wrote little
                            programs that related to what I was doing in my classes. For example, I made a fun little
                            sorting
                            algorithm comparison program
                            so that I could see just how good Quicksort is (spoiler, it's pretty good). My code is
                            available on my <a

                        I probably wasn't timing these in the best way, but it still gives a good overall look at
                        comparing O(n^2)
                        and O(nlgn) runtimes.
                        The fact that being smart about your implementation of an algorithm and not just doing the naive
                        approach
                        can make such a huge
                        difference in the practicality of the software amazes me. Both Mergesort and Quicksort were able
                        to sort
                        1000x more elements that
                        Bubblesort in less time. I think sorting algorithms are really interesting intro level algorithms 
                        that give a taste for what computer science is all about.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I would like to eventually go back and add some more sorts to this list as well as improve my
                        implementations of the current ones. For example,
                        the recursive algorithms can actually benefit by using a 'worse' sort on the smaller list sizes
                        because they
                        are actually faster for fewer elements.
                        Additionally, they can likely be parallelized.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I wish there was an O(nlgn) algorithm for sorting out my life,

                            For now, however, they will remain in one big list. Also note that if you read about a
                            feature on an old
                            post,
                            it is very likely to have been changed in some way in the future.

                            <br />
                            I finished up that little spinny thing at the top. It was all fine and good yesterday, but
                            then I decided
                            I
                            wanted to fix the animation weirdness and ran into a whole slew of issues. For some reason,
                            adding a
                            smooth
                            transition in CSS alone would not fix the width of the box changing abruptly. It required
                            that I also
                            manually
                            change the width in code rather than letting the browser handle it automagically. This was
                            good because it
                            meant
                            that I could size it just how I wanted it (i.e. make it fit the phrase it landed on rather
                            than the
                            longest
                            random phrase that was generated), but it meant that I would have to figure out how long to
                            actually make
                            it. This
                            can be a difficult problem since most fonts are not monospaced, meaning that each letter
                            takes up the same
                            amount of
                            pixels.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I made the box use a monospaced font. Problem solved. Except that none of the
                            smooth transitions worked on the first time it was clicked. This was because 'style.width'
                            component of
                            that div
                            didn't actually exist until I set it for the first time. If there is no previous width, then
                            there is no
                            way to
                            smoothly transition to the new width. I solved this by setting the width of the div to the
                            width of the
                            div
                            (do you see why I dislike this yet?) which is stored in the 'offsetWidth' component (which,
                            of course, is
                            read-only and
                            can't just be used to change the width)
                            once the page was loaded in. Why can't the 'style.width' just have a value at the beginning?
                            (It is
                            because I didn't hardcode
                            in a width attribute at the start, I know, but why can't this value be whatever width the
                            browser decided
                            to give it?)
                            To finish it off, I had to also wait until the
                            page was loaded to add the smooth transition style to div. Otherwise, it would have this
                            funky effect when
                            the page
                            was first loaded in.

                            I usually enjoy the code writing and debugging process. I feel that it is similar to solving
                            a puzzle or
                            investigating
                            some kind of crime where I get to follow a trail of clues until I find the culprit. This is
                            not the
                            feeling that I get
                            when working on websites. Instead, it is more like someone gave me an article to edit, asked
                            me to update
                            some of the wording
                            using a thesaurus, and then yelled at every single suggestion that I ended up making.
                            Instead of testing
                            an algorithm to figure
                            out the cases that are causing it to fail, I am trying seemingly random combinations of
                            keywords until I
                            end up finding what I
                            want. Like with that 'style.width' versus 'offsetWidth' thing above. I have used
                            'style.width' in the past
                            because that is how
                            you change the width of something on the page dynamically, but now I had to search through
                            random
                            StackExchange posts to figure
                            out that there is this whole separate width thing. There is no trail of breadcrumbs in the
                            code for me to
                            follow, just random
                            Google searches to find the one page of documentation that can actually help me.

                            I don't have much to update on today, so I figured I might try to leave my future self a
                            little bit of
                            advice.
                            I mostly worked on brainstorming some ideas and jotting down a bunch of notes about the
                            features I would
                            like this site to have.
                            When I started to actually edit the site a little bit, that little black rectangle at the
                            top of the page
                            in the
                            subheading caught my eye. It subtly reminded me of Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" button for
                            some odd
                            reason. This made
                            me really want to implement a little function that would randomize the text in that box and
                            add some
                            simple animations to it.
                            Go ahead and hover over it and click it a few times. It's pretty fun.
                            All I had to do was copy down a few hundred adjectives and nouns, use some Math.random(),
                            and,
                            unfortunately, toy around with
                            some CSS.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The hardest part was actually setting up the JSON file that holds all of the words and
                            properly accessing
                            it
                            on the site. There are a couple of minor things that I would like to fix, such as the size
                            of the
                            rectangle changing abruptly
                            when new phrases are generated (I think this is going to require just the right Google query
                            to figure
                            out, as the first few
                            'fixes' that I found didn't actually work) and probably removing some of the words so that I
                            don't
                            accidentally create any offensive
                            combinations.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It is feels good when a little thing like this gets created because it can happen in such a
                            short time,
                            even if it does
                            always end up having bugs and requiring me to read some documentation.

                            If you're reading this, chances are that you know me. If that is the case, then you probably
                            also know
                            that I have this fun little habit of starting projects that are doomed to be forgotten. I
                            was looking
                            back at some of these projects a couple of days ago and decided that I would finish a couple
                            of these
                            before starting anything new. Of course, I <em>immediately</em> began work on this website
                            to keep track
                            of these things.
                            So while I might not see all of my projects through to their end, I want to at least go
                            through and
                            document the things that I learn while doing them. This
                            notebook will mainly
                            serve as a place for me to take notes on those projects I have done in the past and those
                            which I will
                            inevitably start
                            in the future. It will also allow me to better keep tabs on where I am with my current
                            projects. You are
                            welcome to read it.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            This marks the start of a new project. I have been meaning to start a personal website for a
                            while, but I
                            am not much of a web developer. I got the idea to also start tracking my work from my friend
                            William
                            Bucher, who
                            recently started a photography blog. I then thought that this would be a good way for me to
                            keep myself
                            honest
                            about working on my side projects. I plan to randomly select a project every day or two from
                            a list of
                            things
                            I am currently working on. Then I will try to work on that project for at least one hour
                            that day and take
                            notes about
                            whatever it is I did or learned. Since I am still figuring out what my schedule will look
                            like for this
                            Fall, this
                            plan may change. I think trying to do work in these short bursts will keep things fresh
                            while also
                            ensuring that
                            I am constantly making forward progress on something. I'm hoping to be able to look back on
                            this and be
                            proud of all of the little
                            things I have accomplished.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            For this website, I used a couple of templates from <a
                                href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp"
                                target="_blank">W3Schools</a>.
                            This allowed me to get a barebones site up very quickly that looks decently passable. It
                            also means that I
                            will have to deal
                            very minimally with CSS. I dislike using CSS. I then went and simplified the color palettes,
                            something I
                            know very little about,
                            so I apologize if the site offends the senses. Finally, I touched it up with a few pictures,
                            some smooth
                            scrolling
                            effects, and this post. I am hoping to make this into a very well-organized notebook with
                            tagged notes and
                            sorting,
                            but that will come later. For now, all of the posts will be hardcoded right here.
